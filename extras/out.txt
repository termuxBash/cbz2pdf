Tama is a Japanese word that can mean several things depending on the context.  The most common meanings are:

* **Ball:**  This is probably the most frequent meaning.  Think of a ball used in games or as a toy.
* **Soul:** This is a less common, but important meaning, particularly in a spiritual or religious context.
* **Egg:**  While less frequent than "ball," Tama can also refer to an egg.
