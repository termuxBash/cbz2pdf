Tama is a Japanese word that can mean several things depending on the context.  Most commonly, it means "ball" or "sphere."  It can also be a given name, often for girls.  

To understand what *you* mean by "Tama," I need more information.  Are you referring to:

* **A specific person named Tama?**
* **A type of ball or sphere?**  (e.g., a Tamagotchi, a type of food)
* **Something else entirely?**

Please provide more context.
