Tama is a Japanese word that means "ball" or "sphere".  It can also be a given name.  Is there anything else I can help you with regarding "Tama"?  For example, are you interested in:

* **The Tamagotchi virtual pet?**
* **A specific person named Tama?**
* **The meaning of the word in a particular context?**

Please provide more information.
