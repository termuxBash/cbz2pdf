Tama is a Japanese word that can mean several things depending on the context.  It most commonly means:

* **Soul/Spirit:** This is a common and important meaning, often used in a spiritual or religious context.

* **Ball:**  This refers to a small, round object.

* **Pearl:**  This is a less common usage, but tama can refer to pearls.

* **Egg:** This is another possible meaning, although less frequent than "soul" or "ball".

Could you provide more context?  Knowing how you intend to use the word will help me give you a more precise answer.
