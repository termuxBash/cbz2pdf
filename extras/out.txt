Tama is a Japanese word that can mean several things depending on the context.  It most commonly means:

* **Soul, spirit:**  This is a more profound meaning, referring to the essence of a being.
* **Ball (as in a spherical object):** This is a common everyday usage.
* **Egg:** This is a less common usage but still valid.


To understand the meaning, I need more context.  What were you thinking of when you said "Tama"?
