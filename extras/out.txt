Tama is a Japanese word that can mean several things depending on the context.  It most commonly means "ball" or "sphere," but it can also be a name,  a shortened version of other words, or even part of a larger word.

To understand what "Tama" means, I need more context.  Could you tell me more about how you encountered this word?  For example:

* **Where did you see or hear it?** (e.g., a book, a game, a conversation)
* **What was the surrounding text or conversation?**
* **What language is it in?** (While you've tagged it as Japanese, confirmation is helpful.)

With more information, I can give you a more precise answer.
