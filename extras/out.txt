Tama is a Japanese word that can mean several things depending on the context.  It's most commonly used as:

* **Soul/spirit:**  This is a more profound meaning, referring to the essence of a being.
* **Ball:**  A common and simple meaning.
* **Egg:** Sometimes used to refer to an egg, particularly a bird's egg.

To understand the meaning better, I need more context.  Where did you see or hear the word "Tama"?  What was the situation?
