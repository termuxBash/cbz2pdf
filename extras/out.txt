Tama is a Japanese word that can mean several things depending on the context.  To understand what it means, I need more information.  For example, is it:

* **A name?**  It's a common Japanese given name.
* **A reference to Tamagotchi?** The popular virtual pet.
* **Part of a sentence or phrase?**  The meaning would depend on the surrounding words.
* **Something else entirely?**

Please provide more context.
