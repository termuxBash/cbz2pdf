Tama is a Japanese word that can mean several things depending on the context.  Most commonly, it means "ball" or "sphere."  It can also be used as a casual, affectionate form of address, similar to "honey" or "sweetheart."  

To understand the meaning better, I need more context.  Could you tell me how you intend to use the word "Tama"?
