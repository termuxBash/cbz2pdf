Tama is a Japanese word that can mean several things depending on the context.  It most commonly means "ball" or "sphere," but it can also be a part of other words or used as a name.  

To understand what "Tama" means, I need more context.  Could you tell me more about how you encountered this word?  For example, what were you reading or watching?
