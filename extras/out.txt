Tama is a Japanese word that can have several meanings depending on the context.  It most commonly means "ball" or "sphere."  It can also be a name, a shortened form of other words, or even an exclamation.  

To understand what "Tama" means, I need more context.  Can you tell me more about how you're using the word?
