Tama is a Japanese word that can mean several things depending on the context.  It most commonly means "ball" or "sphere".  It can also be used as a name, though its meaning in that context is derived from the word's meaning of "ball" or "sphere".  Could you provide more context so I can give you a more precise answer?
