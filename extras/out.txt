Tama is a Japanese word that can mean several things depending on the context.  It most commonly means:

* **Soul/Spirit:** This is a more spiritual or philosophical meaning.

* **Ball:**  This refers to a round object.

* **Occasionally, a name:**  While not incredibly common, Tama can be a given name.

To understand the meaning, I need more context.  Where did you see or hear the word "Tama"?
