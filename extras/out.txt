Tama is a Japanese word meaning "ball" or "sphere".  Is there anything else I can help you with regarding the word "Tama"?  Perhaps you'd like to know:

* **Its usage in specific contexts?** (e.g., Tamagotchi, a popular virtual pet)
* **Related words?**

Please provide more context or clarify your question.
